**This repository is the main collaborative space for the OpenCDMS Web API Standard Working Group (WAS-WG)**

A central component of the OpenCDMS project is collaborating on a CDMS Web API Standard. Specifically:
- The API specifications will define universal APIs for interacting with conformant CDMSs
- The OpenCDMS Reference Implementation will provide a complete implementation of the Web API Standard

Software other than the OpenCDMS Reference Implementation may also conform to the Web API StandardÂ and, in doing so,
they could be certified as being conformant. Being conformant to the Web API Standard would also
guarantee conformance to the WMO CDMS specifications.

---

The Web API Standard will consider
- [OGC API - Features](https://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/ogcapi-features)
- [OGC API - Environmental Data Retrieval](http://docs.opengeospatial.org/DRAFTS/19-086.html)
- [OGC API - Processes](https://github.com/opengeospatial/wps-rest-binding)
- [OGC API - Coverages](https://github.com/opengeospatial/ogc_api_coverages) (see also [
MetOcean Hack](https://www.opengeospatial.org/metoceanhack))
 
Processes will include:
- Hydrological modules (from [MCH](http://www.wmo.int/pages/prog/hwrp/mch/))
- Climatological modules (from [R-Instat](http://r-instat.org) and [Climatol](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=climatol))
